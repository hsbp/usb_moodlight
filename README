Hi, I hope you find this stuff useful.

I include parts of the LUFA library because i needed to modify it slightly
in order to make it compile this project, particularly adding a "-lm" into
lufa_build.mk to include the math lib.

For the beginner, it is much easier to have a project to compile right away
without the need to worry about broken dependencies.

Another thing i had to fix was the cross-avr header that describes the
atmega32u2 because it was incomplete in my distro. I include my version here
for reference. In my distro it goes to /opt/cross/avr/avr/include/avr/iom32u2.h

Hmm, what else...
